# Daily Wellbeing Tracker (Juneâ€“July 2025)

This project analyzes my daily habits and wellbeing during June and July 2025.  
I tracked sleep, mood, productivity, phone use, exercise, and more.

## Structure
- `data/raw/`: Original export from Google Sheets
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned datasets
- `src/`: Scripts for cleaning and feature building
- `notebooks/`: Analysis and visualization

## Quickstart
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run cleaning: `python src/prepare_data.py`
3. Open `notebooks/01_explore.ipynb` and start exploring.

## Goals
- Compare wellbeing between June and July
- Find correlations (e.g., sleep vs productivity)
- Build portfolio-ready visuals
